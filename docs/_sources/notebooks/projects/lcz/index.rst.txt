======================

.. important::

   You are viewing the CESM-LCZ documentation. Current development is for land-only simulation, based on CESM's land component, CTSM. Please note that major infrastructure changes were introduced in CTSM compared to earlier versions (e.g., CLM5.0), which may not be compatible with this documentation.
